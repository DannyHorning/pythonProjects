b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/54-0
00:00:16.817 --> 00:00:20.530
This beginning section is just
our constant variables, so all

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/54-1
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.123
of the, like all the prices and
we're starting off with our

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/54-2
00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:27.237
total phones and devices sold,
which is gonna be 0.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/70-0
00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:34.928
And then I did the basic
calculator part where I put it

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/70-1
00:00:34.928 --> 00:00:37.097
in a while loop so that.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/110-0
00:00:38.557 --> 00:00:43.275
Whenever the user enters 0, it's
going to break this loop and

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/110-1
00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:47.917
then add +1 to the while loop
and then why if the while loop

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/110-2
00:00:47.917 --> 00:00:52.787
ever gets to one, it's going to
exit the loop and calculate our

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/110-3
00:00:52.787 --> 00:00:56.897
profit at the bottom and then
print out daily profit?

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/112-0
00:00:57.237 --> 00:00:57.807
Umm.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/114-0
00:00:59.387 --> 00:01:00.447
The.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/120-0
00:01:02.107 --> 00:01:03.917
If loops are going to be.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/142-0
00:01:04.027 --> 00:01:07.586
And get the phone category is
equal to 0 is gonna break the

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/142-1
00:01:07.586 --> 00:01:11.204
loop and obviously go back to
the beginning and then or exit

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/142-2
00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:13.577
the the while loop. Sorry and
then the.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/174-0
00:01:14.637 --> 00:01:18.449
The other categories are just
the phone categories and it's

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/174-1
00:01:18.449 --> 00:01:22.261
going to have the phone prices
put into it already and then

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/174-2
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:26.200
calculate the price for us and
then print those out. And then

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/174-3
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.487
the if statement here profit
daily.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/189-0
00:01:29.647 --> 00:01:33.506
If this equals uh, if this is
greater than 10,000, is gonna

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/189-1
00:01:33.506 --> 00:01:34.857
print out great work.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/202-0
00:01:35.657 --> 00:01:38.156
And if it's not greater than
10,000, then it's going to print

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/202-1
00:01:38.156 --> 00:01:39.567
out that we didn't reach our
goal.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/209-0
00:01:41.317 --> 00:01:43.117
And that's basically what I did
for the project.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/225-0
00:01:44.747 --> 00:01:50.347
My my point was I coded it,
edited the whole code but like.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/245-0
00:01:51.327 --> 00:01:57.803
Danny's uh by setting each other
off the apples, iPhone and the

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/245-1
00:01:57.803 --> 00:01:59.017
tablet to 0.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/305-0
00:02:00.427 --> 00:02:04.444
And the reason why I did that?
Because uh, so it won't like

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/305-1
00:02:04.444 --> 00:02:08.663
store from the previous answer.
So it would if it's stored the

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/305-2
00:02:08.663 --> 00:02:12.614
previous answer it will mess
around with the next code the

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/305-3
00:02:12.614 --> 00:02:16.966
next calculation. So I just each
set each one back to zero so it

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/305-4
00:02:16.966 --> 00:02:21.319
can be reset and while the loop
still continues. So we could get

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/305-5
00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.457
the right result.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/316-0
00:02:27.377 --> 00:02:30.417
Yeah, you also did the the whole
while loop like with the.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/338-0
00:02:31.077 --> 00:02:35.177
Yeah, I I I said that for each
one each loop.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/337-0
00:02:32.647 --> 00:02:34.917
The loop back to the beginning.
Ohh yeah yeah.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/340-0
00:02:36.137 --> 00:02:36.367
Yeah.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/346-0
00:02:36.907 --> 00:02:39.037
Oh, and then my Pender.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/348-0
00:02:47.907 --> 00:02:48.217
My.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/351-0
00:02:51.527 --> 00:02:52.337
Did we lose my?

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/356-0
00:02:53.447 --> 00:02:54.657
Like his, his muted.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/362-0
00:02:55.827 --> 00:02:56.797
Oh, I'm sorry.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/365-0
00:02:55.887 --> 00:02:56.867
He's muted.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/391-0
00:02:57.397 --> 00:03:01.265
So yeah, so I did the four loop
up part in which we like go

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/370-0
00:02:57.987 --> 00:02:58.547
You know.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/391-1
00:03:01.265 --> 00:03:04.940
through the loops of a whole
week, weekends and the work

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/391-2
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:05.327
weeks.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/453-0
00:03:06.037 --> 00:03:09.642
So in this four days in weekend,
we go through the loop and in

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/453-1
00:03:09.642 --> 00:03:13.133
the first one we just go through
all the days. So while when

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/453-2
00:03:13.133 --> 00:03:16.567
catalog is equal to equal to 1,
then he's gonna ask for the

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/453-3
00:03:16.567 --> 00:03:20.345
phone category and then if phone
category is 0 which is break out

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/453-4
00:03:20.345 --> 00:03:23.492
of the loop and if phone
category is not zero and it's

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/453-5
00:03:23.492 --> 00:03:26.926
less than five, then we go
through all the phone categories

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/453-6
00:03:26.926 --> 00:03:28.357
and calculate the result.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/476-0
00:03:29.067 --> 00:03:34.054
And if won't get into the above,
then five, then we just print N

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/476-1
00:03:34.054 --> 00:03:37.507
and you say user input user
input error and.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/526-0
00:03:38.487 --> 00:03:41.863
At Denry, just say the weak
profit, which is, uh, the same

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/526-1
00:03:41.863 --> 00:03:45.297
thing that Danny spoke is if
it's greater than 10,000, it's

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/526-2
00:03:45.297 --> 00:03:48.731
great work. And if it's less,
more work needed. And then in

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/526-3
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:52.508
here we just reset the values to
0. So the our total is all zeros

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/526-4
00:03:52.508 --> 00:03:56.057
if the if it's the work weekend,
we do the same thing as the.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/540-0
00:03:56.757 --> 00:04:00.587
As the whole week is just, our
four loop is different than the.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/563-0
00:04:01.427 --> 00:04:05.394
A whole week and we just do the
all the same things that we did

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/563-1
00:04:05.394 --> 00:04:09.113
in the work week as we if it
breaks, we get out of the loop

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/563-2
00:04:09.113 --> 00:04:09.857
and if it's.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/622-0
00:04:10.877 --> 00:04:14.040
If it's less than five, we go
through all the phones and all

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/622-1
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.152
that stuff, and then we reset
here, back again, and then as

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/622-2
00:04:17.152 --> 00:04:20.419
the last is the weekend one, and
this is still the same thing,

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/622-3
00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.737
but in the this again, the four
loop is different where it only

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/622-4
00:04:23.737 --> 00:04:26.901
does for Saturday and Sunday and
we just go through the same

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/622-5
00:04:26.901 --> 00:04:29.027
thing we did in the all the
other weeks.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/654-0
00:04:30.097 --> 00:04:34.213
And yet at the end, which just
uh print error and we just print

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/654-1
00:04:34.213 --> 00:04:38.201
the weekend profit as the same
thing less than more than 1000

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/654-2
00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:40.517
great work less than 1000 bad
work.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/682-0
00:04:41.337 --> 00:04:44.867
And if, uh, days or week are out
less than zero and greater than

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/682-1
00:04:44.867 --> 00:04:48.288
four, then it's error. And if
there's a week or zero, then our

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/682-2
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:51.167
program ends and then it
continues after that again.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/686-0
00:04:52.077 --> 00:04:52.547
That's it.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/692-0
00:04:54.137 --> 00:04:56.987
Beautiful. Excellent. Thank you
very much.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/694-0
00:04:56.857 --> 00:04:57.427
OK, nice.

b2d72d7e-7f66-4bdf-a239-ced19ebd01e8/697-0
00:04:59.257 --> 00:04:59.657
Ice.
